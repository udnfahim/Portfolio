    What keeps me engaged in competitive programming is a passion that I have always had; the passion for breaking problems apart, resolving them, and lifting them to a whole new level. This interest of mine has assisted me a lot in working on my analytical as well as algorithmic thinking, helping me work through layers of complex problems effectively and accurately. I do not only think in this manner with regards to programming, I also resort to such methods while trying to work things out in other fields of interest like physics, the logical thinking that is needed during competitive programming is similar.
    Since I was a child physics has captivated my attention, especially the process aspect of the science, where it requires a methodical and systematic way of looking at the world. When I begin to think of possibilities in a real-life context, interdisciplinary creativity becomes valuable and this is exactly what motivates me in coding and scientific research. Such kind of thinking helps me in developing solutions to problems, as a result I am able to be versatile when it comes to the technical and analytical challenges that I am faced with.
    Outside of working on technical things, I am passionate about traveling. Traveling opened up new opportunities for me, broadening my horizon and allowing me to live in different settings. It has been a great tool for improving my coping mechanisms, quick decision-making, and flexibility in the face of new and uncharted challenges. These abilities are useful both personally and professionally.
    Handled in unison, my skillset in problem-solving and love of physics, along with being an experienced traveler, formulate a well-rounded, analytical and flexible thinker who is able to come up with innovative solutions to challenges.
